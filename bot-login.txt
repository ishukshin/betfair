Create a public/private RSA key pair using openssl

> openssl genrsa -out client-2048.key 2048

Updateopenssl configuration file (openssl.cnf) for OpenSSL to override some of the default settings: 

[ ssl_client ]
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
nsCertType = client
keyUsage = digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth

Create a certificate signing request (CSR).

> openssl req -new -key client-2048.key -out client-2048.csr
 
 
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:GB
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:London
Locality Name (eg, city) []:London
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:yourcompany.com
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Security Team
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:Test API-NG Certificate
Email Address []:my.name@mydomain.com
 
Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:
An optional company name []:
 

Self-sign the certificate request to create a certificate

> openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in client-2048.csr -signkey client-2048.key -out client-2048.crt -extfile openssl.cnf -extensions ssl_client 

Then take client-2048.crt and upload it into https://myaccount.betfair.com/accountdetails/mysecurity?showAPI=1

To create a PEM format file that contains both the private key and the certificate you can use the following command:

Linux
> cat client-2048.crt client-2048.key > client-2048.pem

Then use this files to login.
